# OpenVaccine-COVID-19-mRNA-Vaccine-Degradation-Prediction

The aim of this project is to create a model that can predict the rate of degradation of each base of each mRNA sequence of a subset from a dataset containing 3029 RNA sequences. We have three qualitative and structural pieces of information describing mRNA sequences: sequence, base pairing and loop prediction. We are therefore going to create three prediction models by taking only the sequence as an explanatory variable at first, then a second model which will take into account the sequence and the base pairing information and finally a third model which will take into account the three explanatory variables. Then we will compare these three models to see which is better and especially if the introduction of structural information improves the prediction.
